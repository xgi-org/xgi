To install and use XGI as an end user, execute

.. code:: bash

   pip install xgi

To install for development purposes, first clone the repository and then execute

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .['all']

If that command does not work, you may try the following instead

.. code:: zsh

   pip install -e .\[all\]

XGI was developed and tested for Python 3.8-3.12 on Mac OS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
