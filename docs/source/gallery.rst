Here are several examples of figures made using XGI:

    :alt: Image of a hypergraph with nodes colored and sized by different properties.

    A visualization of the email-enron dataset with hyperedges of sizes 2 and 3 (all isolated nodes removed). The nodes are colored by their degree and their size proportional to the Clique motif Eigenvector Centrality.

.. figure:: assets/images/Simpliciality_2023_Fig3.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Image of a hypergraph with nodes colored by their simpliciality measures.

    The local (A) simplicial fraction, (B) edit simpliciality, and (C) face edit simpliciality of the email-enron dataset filtered to include interactions of sizes 2 and 3. The colors of the histogram bars match the node colors on their corresponding network visualization. Nodes for which the local simpliciality is undefined are colored in grey.

.. figure:: assets/images/Filtering_2024_Fig1.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Image of a hypergraph decomposed into various edge-based filterings.

    An illustration of a hypergraph with hyperedges of sizes two through five, visualized using XGI. This hypergraph is decomposed using different types of filtering (uniform, GEQ, LEQ, and exclusion) for different filtering parameters, :math:`k`.
