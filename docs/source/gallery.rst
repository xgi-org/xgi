Here are several examples of figures made using XGI:

.. figure:: assets/images/XGI_2023_Fig2.png

    :alt: Image of a hypergraph with nodes colored and sized by different properties.

    A visualization of the email-enron dataset with hyperedges of sizes 2 and 3 (all isolated nodes removed). The nodes are colored by their degree and their size proportional to the Clique motif Eigenvector Centrality.

.. figure:: assets/images/Simpliciality_2023_Fig3.png
    :width: 400
    :alt: Image of a hypergraph with nodes colored by their simpliciality measures.

    The local (A) simplicial fraction, (B) edit simpliciality, and (C) face edit simpliciality of the email-enron dataset filtered to include interactions of sizes 2 and 3. The colors of the histogram bars match the node colors on their corresponding network visualization. Nodes for which the local simpliciality is undefined are colored in grey.
