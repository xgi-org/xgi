About
=====

The Comple\ **X** **G**\ roup **I**\ nteractions `(XGI) <https://github.com/ComplexGroupInteractions/xgi>`_
library provides data structures and algorithms for modeling and analyzing complex systems
with group (higher-order) interactions.

Many datasets can be represented as graphs, where pairs of entities (or nodes) are
related via links (or edges).  Examples are road networks, energy grids, social
networks, neural networks, etc.  However, in many other datasets, more than two entities
can be related at a time.  For example, many scientists (entities) can collaborate on a
scientific article together (links), and multiple email accounts (entities) can all
participate on the same email thread (links).  In this latter case, graphs no longer
present a viable alternative to represent such datasets.  It is for this kind of
datasets, where the interactions are given among groups of more than two entities (also
called higher-order interactions), that XGI was designed for.

XGI is implemented in pure Python and is designed to seamlessly interoperate with the
rest of the Python scientific stack (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, etc).  XGI is
designed and developed by network scientists with the needs of network scientists in
mind.

Installation
============

To install and use XGI as an end user, execute

.. code:: bash

   pip install xgi

To install for development purposes, first clone the repository and then execute

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .['all']

If that command does not work, you may try the following instead

.. code:: zsh

   pip install -e .\[all\]

XGI was developed and tested for Python 3.7-3.11 on Mac OS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
