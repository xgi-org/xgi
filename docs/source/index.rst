About
=====

The Comple\ **X** **G**\ roup **I**\ nteractions `(XGI) <https://github.com/ComplexGroupInteractions/xgi>`_
library provides data structures and algorithms for modeling and analyzing complex systems
with group (higher-order) interactions.

- Repository: https://github.com/ComplexGroupInteractions/xgi
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/xgi/
- Documentation: https://xgi.readthedocs.io/


Installation
============

To install and use XGI as an end user, execute

.. code:: bash

   pip install xgi

To install for development purposes, first clone the repository and then execute

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .['all']

If that command does not work, you may try the following instead

.. code:: zsh

   pip install -e .\[all\]

XGI was developed and tested for Python 3.7-3.10 on Mac OS, Windows, and Ubuntu.
