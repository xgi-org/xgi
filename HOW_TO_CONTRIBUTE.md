## Pull Request process

4. Run `pytest` to verify all unit tests pass.
5. Identify the unnecessary imports in the
   1. source code by running `pylint xgi/ --disable all --enable W0611`
   2. notebooks by running `nbqa pylint . --disable all --enable W0611`
6. Remove these unnecessary imports.
7. Sort the import statements in the
   1. source code by running `isort .`
   2. notebooks by running `nbqa isort .` to sort any new import statements in the source code and tutorials.
8. Format the source code and notebooks by running `black .` for consistent styling.
9.  Submit Pull Request with a list of changes, links to issues that it addresses (if applicable)

## New Version process
1. Make sure that the Github Actions workflow runs without any errors.
2. Using the `github-changelog` package (a dependency in the [release](requirements/release.txt) requirements file), run `changelog -m xgi-org xgi [last release tag]` to get the merged pull requests with their links. Paste this into the changelog file under a new heading and edit to make more legible. Associate a GitHub username with each pull request.
3. Increase the version number in [setup.py](setup.py) and [conf.py](docs/source/conf.py) to the new version agreed upon by the core developers. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Commit these changes.
5. Create a new release on GitHub by selecting "Releases", then clicking "Draft a new release". Click "Choose a tag" and type "v" followed by the version number and then click "Create new tag". The release title will be this same string. Paste the contents of the CHANGELOG into the "Describe this release" field. Click "Publish release".
6. Run `python setup.py sdist` from the main folder. This will create a zipped file to upload to PyPI and save it to the "dist" folder.
6. Using `twine` (a dependency in the [release](requirements/release.txt) requirements file), run `twine upload dist/xgi-[version number].tar.gz`. Enter your username and password.
4. The new version is now on PyPI.
