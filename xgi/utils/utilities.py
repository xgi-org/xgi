    Helper function to make sure the uid counter is set correctly after

    If we don't set the start of self._edge_uid correctly, it will start at 0,

    use the somewhat convoluted float(e).is_integer() instead of using
    isinstance(e, int) because there exist integer-like numeric types (such as
    np.int32) which fail the isinstance() check.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : xgi.Hypergraph
        Hypergraph of which to update the uid counter
    id : any hashable type
        User-provided ID.
