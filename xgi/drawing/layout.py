    For every node, a position is generated by choosing each of dim coordinates
    uniformly at random on the interval [0.0, 1.0).  NumPy (http://scipy.org) is
    required for this function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    H : Hypergraph or SimplicialComplex
        A position will be assigned to every node in HG.
    center : array-like, optional
        Coordinate pair around which to center the layout.
        If None (default), does not center the positions.
    dim : int, optional
        Dimension of layout, by default 2.
    seed : int, optional
        Set the random state for deterministic node layouts.
        If int, `seed` is the seed used by the random number generator,
        If None (default), random numbers are sampled from the
        numpy random number generator without initialization.

    Returns
    -------

    --------

    >>> H = xgi.random_hypergraph(N, ps)
