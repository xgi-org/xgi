        If the sums of the degrees are not divisible by m, the

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes

        - If the length of sizes and p do not match.
        - If p is not a tensor with every dimension equal

        Valid options are "prob" or "degree", by default "prob"
    multiedges : bool, optional
        Whether or not to allow multiedges. If True, there
        can be significant speedups but at the cost of creating
        (potentially unwanted) artifacts. When multiedges=True,
        it treats each edge permutation as distinct, which can

    Hypergraph

    See Also
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    When `multiedges=True`, there is the possibility of generating
    (potentially unwanted) artifacts, like multiedges and loopy
    hyperedges which are not present in the original Erdos-Renyi model.
    Because hypergraphs in XGI only store edges as sets, when an edge
    such as (0, 0, 0) is generated will be mapped to {0}. However,
    because this is explicitly a *uniform* method, we discard these edges.
    For sparse networks, this is a rare occurrence and allowing these
    artifacts offers an order of magnitude speedup. Although allowing
    loopy hyperedges and multiedges is not the default behavior, this
    (as well as the associated performance boost) is enabled by setting
    `multiedges=True`.
